# Open Letter to Developers

"The ducks know first when the river water warms in spring, and that's when the pufferfish are about to come up!"

Dear friends, I’m John, a Java programmer working in an ordinary company. Today, with my deepest sincerity, I’m writing this open letter to you who love AI technology and innovation.

Half a year ago, I saw many excellent projects, such as `Dify`, `Chat2DB` and other artificial intelligence-related projects. I thought, how great it would be if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "I have no way to serve my country and have wasted ten years writing code."

I came across a video by Xia Ge's team in early 2025 and was very curious about how they achieved this. I wanted to replicate their backend services and build a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Unfortunately, the work I've done so far is still just a dumb artificial intelligence: low concurrency, soulless, slow to respond, and full of bugs.

The Xia Ge team is a role model for us to learn from. I'd love to have a Xiaozhi backend service as intelligent as theirs. However, I also understand Xia Ge's decision not to open source. As the saying goes, "A single flower does not make spring; a hundred flowers in full bloom make the garden full of spring." Perhaps the era of widespread AI will arrive in our generation. We can use our own hands to create a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Personally, I believe that what they can achieve, we can too; it's just a matter of time. I call this "our journey to learn from them."

So what difficulties will we encounter on this journey to obtain the scriptures? I believe there will be no fewer than eighty-one. Along the way, various monsters will inevitably appear, but there will also be gods secretly helping us, and some people will join the journey to obtain the scriptures.

If you find the above funny, then I feel very lucky. I was able to make you laugh for five seconds in your 30,000-plus days of life, which is a contribution I made to you.

I don’t know whether the idea of ​​a low-cost civilian Jarvis will fail, but isn’t this kind of failure very common in the lives of ordinary people like us?

One thing is certain: someone will completely replicate the functionality of the Xiage team and create a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Will that project be ours?

We look forward to working with you to create a better future.

# Attached Development Contribution Guide
## Project Goals

1. **Civilian low-cost Jarvis solution**  

2. **Intelligent linkage solutions for peripheral hardware**  

## Join us

We warmly welcome like-minded friends to join us and contribute to the project. You can check out the features we are working on in the near future at [this link](https://github.com/users/xinnan-tech/projects/3). There are some features on the list that have not yet been assigned to relevant personnel, and we urgently need your participation. How to participate is as follows:

### 1. Become a regular contributor

Fork the project, submit a PR, and have it reviewed by the developer before being merged into the main branch.

2. Become a Developer

After you have submitted 3 valid PRs in total, you can contact the group owner to apply to become a developer. The group owner will invite you to join the independent developer group to discuss the future of the project together.

## Developer Development Process

1. **Create a new branch**  
   Please develop each functional point in a new branch. The branch name should be concise and clear so that people can see the implemented function at a glance to avoid functional conflicts.

2. **Submit PR for review**  
   After the function development is completed, please submit a PR on GitHub, which will be reviewed by other developers and merged into the main branch after passing the review.
