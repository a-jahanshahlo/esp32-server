# FAQ‚ùì

### 1. Why does Xiaozhi recognize a lot of Korean, Japanese, and English when I speak? üá∞üá∑

Suggestion: Check if `models/SenseVoiceSmall` already has `model.pt`
If you don't have the file, you need to download it. See here [Download the speech recognition model file](Deployment.md#Model file)

### 2. Why does "TTS task error file does not exist" appear? üìÅ

Suggestion: Check whether `conda` is used to install `libopus` and `ffmpeg` libraries correctly.

If not installed, install it

```
conda install conda-forge::libopus
conda install conda-forge::ffmpeg
```

### 3. TTS often fails and times out ‚è∞

Recommendation: If `EdgeTTS` frequently fails, please check whether you are using a proxy (router). If so, try disabling the proxy and try again.  
If you are using Doubao TTS with Volcano Engine and it often fails, it is recommended to use the paid version because the test version only supports 2 concurrent users.

### 4. I can connect to my own server using Wifi, but I can't connect using 4G modeüîê

Reason: In Xia Ge's firmware, 4G mode requires a secure connection.

Solution: There are currently two solutions. Choose one:

1. Change the code. Refer to this video to solve the problem https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18MfTYoE85

2. Use nginx to configure SSL certificate. Refer to the tutorial https://icnt94i5ctj4.feishu.cn/docx/GnYOdMNJOoRCljx1ctecsj9cnRe

### 5. How to improve Xiaozhi's dialogue response speed? ‚ö°

The default configuration of this project is a low-cost solution. It is recommended that beginners use the default free model first to solve the problem of "running well" and then optimize the "running fast".  
If you need to improve response speed, you can try replacing various components. Since version 0.5.2, the project supports streaming configuration, which improves response speed by about 2.5 seconds compared to earlier versions, significantly improving the user experience.

| Module Name | Get Started with Free Setup | Streaming Configuration |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ASR (Speech Recognition) | FunASR (Local) | üëçFunASR (Local GPU Mode) |
| LLM (Large Model) | ChatGLMLLM (Zhipuglm-4-flash) | üëçAliLLM (qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507) or üëçDoubaoLLM (doubao-1-5-pro-32k-250115) |
| VLLM (Visual Large Model) | ChatGLMVLLM (Zhipu glm-4v-flash) | üëçQwenVLVLLM (Qianwen qwen2.5-vl-3b-instructh) |
| TTS (Text-to-Speech) | ‚úÖLinkeraiTTS (Lingxi Streaming) | üëçHuoshanDoubleStreamTTS (Huoshan Double Stream Text-to-Speech) or üëçAliyunStreamTTS (Aliyun Stream Text-to-Speech) |
| Intent (intent recognition) | function_call (function call) | function_call (function call) |
| Memory (memory function) | mem_local_short (local short-term memory) | mem_local_short (local short-term memory) |

If you are concerned about the time consumption of each component, please refer to the [Xiaozhi Component Performance Test Report](https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-performance-research) and conduct actual tests in your environment according to the test methods in the report.

### 6. I speak very slowly, and when I pause, Xiaozhi always interrupts me.

Suggestion: Find the following section in the configuration file and increase the value of `min_silence_duration_ms` (for example, to `1000`):

```yaml
VAD:
  SileroVAD:
    threshold: 0.5
    model_dir: models/snakers4_silero-vad
    min_silence_duration_ms: 700 # If the pauses in speaking are long, you can increase this value
```
